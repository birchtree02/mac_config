Mac OS X Configuration
======================

These scripts will configure Mac OS X the way we want, including:

  * Configuring OS preferences
  * Installing applications
  * Configuring applications

These scripts are written for Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks).
The scripts should all be idempotent.
(That means that you can run them as many times as you want.)
